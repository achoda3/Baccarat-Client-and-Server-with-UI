# Baccarat-Client-and-Server-with-UI
Both Server and Client have their pom files and can indepedently be compiled and run with maven like so: <br>
mvn clean compile <br>
mvn exec:java <br>
In Server, please put a port (ex:5555, or if that's taken some other 4 digit number) <br>
In Client, unless you decide to host a server, you can just use your localhost ip which is 127.0.0.1 and the port used above <br>
Finally your UI will look like follows <br>
